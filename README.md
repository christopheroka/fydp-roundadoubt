We create a novel pedestrian alert system using princples from transportation, human factors, electrical, mechanical and machine learning engineering as part of the UWaterloo engneering Undergraduate thesis/capstone research. We found that signalization (such as a custom flashing light and and floor level illumination) can statistically reduce driving speeds through roundabouts. We developed a full scale working prototype and a small diorama of our solution.

# Abstract:
Roundabouts in the Region of Waterloo have been widely implemented due to lower costs, improved traffic flow, and reduced vehicular collisions, but pedestrian safety remains a significant concern, with many reporting anxiety and difficulty crossing. We addressed this gap by designing a novel pedestrian alert system informed by stakeholder interviews, literature, and survey data. Several pedestrian signalling systems were tested in a high-fidelity driving simulator with 15 participants and 225 trials, using eye tracking and driver behaviour data to assess effectiveness. Two designs, a ground-level floor light, and a multi-directional sign, were found to significantly reduce vehicle speeds and improve driver attention on crossing pedestrians. A physical prototype was built with integrated lighting and a camera-based detection system as a proof of concept for real-time pedestrian alerting functionality.  The development of the pedestrian alert system underscored the effectiveness of simulated environments in prototyping and evaluating transportation design concepts.  Future system iterations will focus on enhancing the detection and mitigation of  pedestrian-vehicle near-miss incidents.
